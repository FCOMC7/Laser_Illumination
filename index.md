# Modular fiber-coupled laser illumination

The modular fiber-coupled laser illumination is a free and open-source system that features lasers with various wavelengths coupled in a single optic fiber, enabling easy digital selection without any structural modifications. The system is modular, allowing individual parts to be repurposed and improved in the open-source hardware sense, and easily combined, exchanged, or used on their own.
